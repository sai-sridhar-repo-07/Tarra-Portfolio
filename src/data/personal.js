  bio: `I'm a Software Developer and Machine Learning enthusiast currently working as an LMS Technical Analyst & Data Analyst at Accenture. I build data-driven systems, full-stack platforms, and applied ML solutions that solve real-world problems.`,
  longBio: `I currently work at Accenture supporting SAP SuccessFactors Learning, where I analyze enterprise-scale LMS data, automate workflows, and design analytics dashboards for global clients.

Beyond my professional role, I actively build scalable systems and AI projects. I developed DemandCast, a large-scale demand forecasting system using LSTM, XGBoost, and FastAPI, and SkillSwap, a real-time peer-to-peer microlearning platform powered by WebRTC and a credit-based economy.

My interests lie in Machine Learning, backend systems, and building intelligent applications that combine strong engineering fundamentals with data-driven decision making. I continuously practice DSA and competitive programming, and I regularly explore research papers to strengthen my AI foundations.`,
